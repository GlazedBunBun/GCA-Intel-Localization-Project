# GCA-Intel-Localization-Project
This project was created as a student of the Global Career Accelerator (GCA) program during studies at UTA. <br> The GCA Web Dev course provides students the experience of web development coding while using AI as a *tool*.
<br><br> The objective is to develop an Intel *INSPIRED* webpage to promote their sustainability goals.

# Breakdown
* Students are expected to create a webpage aligning with existing Intel design themes.
* Students are expected to create a responsive page with accessibility in mind.
* This project took me less than a week to complete.

# Dev notes and Transparency
* For code projects during my studies at the Global Career Accelerator, I purposely minimize AI generated code in my workflow as a Computer Science student. I believe there is a reasonable expectation to set upon myself doing these projects (GCA is my first exposure to Web Dev projects). This is done to challenge my learning even if use of AI is allowed.
  * At the time I did not record a personal history of how I may have utilized AI, so the breakdown is from the best of my memory in level of certainty.
* **Github Copilot Usage**: Minimal
  * Debugging (certain)
  * Format tweaks (most certain)
* **OpenAI ChatGPT**: Minimal
  * Image generation (certain)
* **Microsoft Copilot**: Minimal
  * Image generation (certain)
